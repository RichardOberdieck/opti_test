# Introduction

Testing means making sure stuff works. So why don't we do it? Actually, we do! Almost always, we write one or two examples, run them in a Jupyter notebook, "just to make sure it works". That's testing!

So why is it worth talking about? Because often, we only test a small part of all the components of our code. Because often, we do this manually when we done with something. This is as if the only testing Mercedes would do for your new car would be to have someone drive it around the factory once and declare it ok. Ask yourself: **if this was the only testing done, would you still drive the car?**

My guess is no. For me, it's a hard no (also, I don't have a Mercedes). I want every nut and bolt of my imaginary Mercedes to be stress tested way beyond anything I will ever encounter in real life.

The same is true for software. It may not put your life at risk if it malfunctions (although [that is not unheard of](https://barrgroup.com/sites/default/files/KillerApps_Barr_OFFICIAL.pdf)), but just consider every piece of software you interact with on a daily basis. Your expectation is that it runs correctly. But how can you be sure? Because we test.

## Testing software is easy

Staying with car analogy for a minute. Consider what you need to do to test a physical object: you need controlled conditions, you need infrastructure, you need space. Software testing needs the same things, but they are all digital: we need computers, we need isolated software environments and so on, but they only exist as digits, not in "real life".

So testing software is infinitely easier than testing hardware. The only reason we don't do it properly is because don't prioritize it, or we don't know how to.

I hope I convinced you of the fact that you should prioritize it, let's now tackle the "how-to".
